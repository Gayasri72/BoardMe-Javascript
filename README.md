We have successfully completed our Second-year, Second-semester ITP project using the MERN stack. BoardMe is a comprehensive Cospace booking and listing website that offers convenient features such as co-space Reservations, Event Bookings, co space listing and advertisements publishing nd all consolidated in one platform. To style our website, we employed Tailwind CSS. We diligently adhered to the Agile methodology throughout the project, ensuring efficient development.
